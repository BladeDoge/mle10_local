Q: What does it mean to create a Docker image and why do we use Docker images
A: To create a Docker image is to create a read-only template that contains a set of instructions 
   for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. We use them because it is a 
   convenient way to package up applications (code,runtime,system tools, system libraries, settings) 
   and preconfigured server environments, which can be deployed (as a container) on any system that 
   has the Docker platform installed. Simply put, it lets us share the exact same environment with 
   another person. This docker image can be made via a plain-text file known as a Dockerfile or 
   interactively from and existing Docker image and manually tweaking it and saving out the new 
   docker image. 

Q: Please explain what is the difference from a Container vs a Virtual Machine?
A: 
              Docker Container                ||         Virtual Machine
              ============================================================================================
Boot time          ~several seconds           ||        ~several minutes
Runs on            execution engine           ||        hypervisor
Memory             less memory required       ||        require entire OS to load first
Isolation          no provisions              ||        isolation mechanism in place
Deployment         runs anywhere with docker  ||        can't just move one VM from one machine to another
OS relationship    shared Host OS             ||        Each VM has host and guest OS within it
Usage              more complex initial setup ||        simpler plug and play

Q: What are 5 examples of container orchestration tools (please list tools)?
A: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Redhat OpenShift, Apache Mesos, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

Q: How does a Docker image differ from a Docker container?
A: A Docker image is the read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container. 
   A container is what is created when docker builds a docker image, aka a container is launched from an image
   and is a 'container layer' that is actually interacted with by users or machines.
